# GroceryBee
GroceryBee is a robot to assist grocery stores in keeping up with their online orders. GroceryBee will help grocery store employees by collecting the items which are required for an online order from the store shelves, thus speeding up the delivery process. Additionally, GroceryBee will restock shelves which are empty and keep updated stock information in order to inform customers on whether a product is available in the store or not.
